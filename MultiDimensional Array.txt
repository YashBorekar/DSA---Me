A multidimensional array is an array with more than one dimension. 
It means that it can grow in different directions i.e. 
instead of changing the length only, it can also change in width,
depth or more.

data_type array_name[s1][s2]...[sn];

// Two dimensional array
int two_d[2][4];

// Three dimensional array
int three_d[2][4][8];

For example, consider the below array:
int arr1[2][4];
The array int arr[2][4] can store total (2 * 4) = 8 elements (product of its dimensions).
